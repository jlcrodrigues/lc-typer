# LC Typer

*LCOM Project for group T07G02.*

LC typer is a typing tutor developed for the Minix OS. This was part of the Computer Laboratory course unit @ FEUP.
The main focus of the project was for it to be developed with a low-level approach. This meant creating our own I/O drivers (e.g. video card, mouse, timer, ..) while exploring the C programming language.
For more details, please refer to the [full report](proj/doc/report.pdf).
